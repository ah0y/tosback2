+<li>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
+In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.
+Moreover, if 500px, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</li>
+<li>Protection of 500px and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law.
+to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies.
+or to protect the rights, property, or safety of 500px, our employees, our users, or others.
+This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
+<li>User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other 500px users in your User Profile.

+However, until your account is deleted, you may receive all system emails.
+Children Under 18 Years of Age <p>You must be 14 years and older to register to use the 500px website.
+As a result, 500px does not specifically collect information about children.
+If we learn that 500px has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
